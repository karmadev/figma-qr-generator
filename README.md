2. Unzip the contents.
3. Open a Terminal window and navigate to the unzipped folder: ´´´cd/path/to/unzipped/folder´´´
4. Run the build command and wait for it to complete: ´´´npm run build´´´

5. Open Figma for Desktop and your design file.
6. Click Plugins > Developer > Add plugin from manifest.

## Usage

1. Select a template design from [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/5QAD5jKaVZdeAeKFvTSalV/Templates?node-id=0-1&t=IMmoVuILFUkRlgyg-0). Do not edit this file; only copy designs from it.

7. Input table numbers and storefront links as prompted.
8. Choose colors and settings.
9. Set prefix/suffix for table numbers if desired.
10. Click generate.
11. Export the designs as PDF to maintain vectorization for printing.
